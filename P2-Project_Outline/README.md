# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Website for "Mathercise". Mathercise is an incentive program for 1st graders at my son's school to learn the basic facts in math. The goal is for all students to have automaticity of all addition and subtraction facts with sums to 20. Mathercise consists of Daily Exercise and Fitness Test. Daily Exercise is done with a set of flash cards which students bring home and study at home. Every Friday they take Fitness Test (an assessment) so teachers can monitor their progress.
While I was a Mathercise volunteer, helping teachers with assessment process, I noticed a few things that I wish would be improved:
*  Fitness Test (I believe it is in Keynote file format) was installed on each student's iPad for each level as they progress. Often times students did not have a test for their latest level. It required extra time either installing a test on a student's iPad to give the test, or tracking down an iPad which already had a test for the level we were looking for. 
*  Students' progress was all tracked on paper-based filing system. (Test date, correct answers, incorrect answers, scores, current level). Often times, I noticed that the current level was not recorded correctly; it took extra time to figure out which level a student was actually at.  
* Correct answers and incorrect answers were recorded by hand, score was calculated manually. Prone to error and take more time. 
* Fitness Test contain questions only; no correct answers were provided anywhere (Hence volunteers needed to do math along with students while recording their answers and scoring them.) Prone to error and take more time.
* Anything that required extra time used up allocated Fitness Test time, meaning fewer students were  tested.
* Fitness Test did not take place when no volunteers were available. 
* No systematic way to give Fitness Test to all students equally. Some students had more opportunities to take test than some others.
* Some students did not seem to be doing Daily Exercise, perhaps because the exercise was flash card based which required students to work with their "coach" at home who can check their answers (Flash cards don't have correct answers written on them.)
