## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Website for "Mathercise". Mathercise is an incentive program for 1st graders at my son's school to learn the basic facts in math. The goal is for all students to have automaticity of all addition and subtraction facts with sums to 20. Mathercise consists of Daily Exercise and Fitness Test. Daily Exercise is done with a set of flash cards which students bring home and study at home. Every Friday they take Fitness Test (an assessment) so teachers can monitor their progress.
When I was a Fitness Test volunteer, I felt Mathercise was a very manual heavy process - The only feature that was online was displaying Fitness Test questions. All the rest was done via paper-based materials. I decided to make this project as an attempt to move Mathercise online to run it smoother, more efficient and more accurate with fewer resources.
